name: duk_push_string

proto: |
  const char *duk_push_string(duk_context *ctx, const char *str);

stack: |
  [ ... ] -> [ ... str! ] (if str != NULL)
  [ ... ] -> [ ... null! ] (if str == NULL)

summary: |
  <p>Push a C string into the stack.  String length is automatically detected
  with a <code>strlen()</code> equivalent (i.e. looking for the first NUL character).
  A pointer to the interned string data is returned.  If the operation fails,
  throws an error.</p>

  <p>If <code>str</code> is <code>NULL</code>, an ECMAScript <code>null</code> is pushed
  to the stack and <code>NULL</code> is returned.  This behavior differs from
  <code><a href="#duk_push_lstring">duk_push_lstring</a></code> on purpose.</p>

  <div class="note">
  C code should normally only push valid WTF-8 strings to the stack.

  Some invalid CESU-8/UTF-8 byte sequences are reserved for special
  uses such as representing Symbol values.  When you push such an invalid
  byte sequence, the value on the value stack will behave like a string for
  C code but will appear as a <code>Symbol</code> for ECMAScript code.
  See <a href="guide.html#symbols">Symbols</a> for more discussion.

  Input strings not matching the internal Symbol representation will be
  sanitized to WTF-8: UTF-8 is accepted as is, paired surrogates encoded in
  (loose) CESU-8 will be combined to UTF-8, unpaired surrogates encoded in
  (loose) CESU-8 will be left as is, and invalid byte sequences will be
  replaced with one or more U+FFFD characters.  Replacement behavior
  matches <a href="http://unicode.org/review/pr-121.html">Recommended Practice for Replacement Characters</a>
  (same as TextDecoder).

  Internal string representation was changed from (loose) CESU-8 +
  extended UTF-8 to WTF-8 in Duktape 3.x.
  </div>

  <p>If input string might contain internal NUL characters, use
  <code><a href="#duk_push_lstring">duk_push_lstring()</a></code> instead.</p>

example: |
  duk_push_string(ctx, "foo");
  duk_push_string(ctx, "foo\0bar");  /* push "foo", not "foo\0bar" */
  duk_push_string(ctx, "");          /* push empty string */
  duk_push_string(ctx, NULL);        /* push 'null' */
